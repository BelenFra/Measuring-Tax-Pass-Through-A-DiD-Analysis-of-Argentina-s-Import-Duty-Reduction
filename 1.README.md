# Measuring Tax Pass-Through: A DiD Analysis of Argentina's Import Duty Reduction

> **Decision Analytics for the real world:** Analyzed the -2.11% price impact of Argentina’s tax reduction using DiD in R and Python. I moved beyond "fancy charts" to isolate causal effects, providing data-driven insights for strategic retail decisions.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **`/data`**: Contains `raw_data.csv` (original) and `df_clean.csv` (processed).
- **`/notebooks`**: `1_Data_Cleaning_EDA.ipynb` (Python logic, outlier removal, and parallel trends check).
- **`/scripts`**: `2_Econometric_Modeling.R` (Fixed effects regression and robustness tests).
- **`/reports`**: `Final_Report_Tax_Impact.pdf` (Executive summary of findings).

## 1. Project Overview
In September 2024, Argentina implemented a significant fiscal change, reducing the **Impuesto PAIS** on imported goods from **17.5% to 7.5%**. This project investigates the causal effect of this policy on consumer prices in the Food & Beverage sector using a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** approach.

## 2. Methodology & Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Data Wrangling) & R (Econometrics).
- **The "Decision Analytics" Edge:** - Verified the **Parallel Trends Assumption** by plotting pre-event trajectories.
    - Curated data by excluding categories like *Cookies* and *Canned Goods* that violated parallelism.
    - Applied **Logarithmic Transformations** to coefficients for a percentage-based interpretation of the 2.11% drop.

## 3. Key Findings
- **Average Impact:** Prices for imported products dropped **2.11% more** than national products.
- **Heterogeneity:** The impact varied significantly by category, suggesting that inventory turnover and competition affect the speed of tax pass-through.

## 4. Robustness & Validation
To ensure results weren't coincidental, I performed:
1. **Placebo Date Test:** Simulated the event on a fake date (no effect found).
2. **Placebo Group Test:** Assigned "imported" status to local products (no effect found).

## 5. Data Source
Original dataset curated by **Unidad de Impacto** at [Impuesto_PAIS_2024](https://github.com/unidaddeimpacto/Impuesto_PAIS_2024).
